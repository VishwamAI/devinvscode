# Automation Features Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation details for the full automation features in the "devinvscode" extension. The features include auto coding, auto folders creating, auto tasking, auto planning, auto terminaling, and auto learning and researching.

## Features

### 1. Auto Coding
**Description:** Generate code based on user prompts.
**Implementation Details:**
- Integrate an AI model capable of understanding user prompts and generating code snippets.
- Implement the `generateCodeFromPrompt` function to utilize the AI model for code generation.
- Handle different programming languages and frameworks.

### 2. Auto Folders Creating
**Description:** Create folders within the project structure as required.
**Implementation Details:**
- Implement a function to create folders based on user input or predefined project templates.
- Ensure the function can handle nested folder structures.
- Provide feedback to the user upon successful folder creation.

### 3. Auto Tasking
**Description:** Manage and execute development tasks autonomously.
**Implementation Details:**
- Implement a task manager to handle various development tasks such as building, testing, and deploying code.
- Allow users to define custom tasks and automate their execution.
- Provide real-time feedback on task progress and completion.

### 4. Auto Planning
**Description:** Plan development steps based on project requirements.
**Implementation Details:**
- Implement a planning module to analyze project requirements and suggest development steps.
- Allow users to input project goals and milestones.
- Generate a development roadmap and update it based on progress and feedback.

### 5. Auto Terminaling
**Description:** Execute necessary commands in the terminal.
**Implementation Details:**
- Implement a function to execute shell commands within the VS Code integrated terminal.
- Allow users to define custom commands and automate their execution.
- Provide real-time feedback on command execution and output.

### 6. Auto Learning and Researching
**Description:** Improve the AI model over time and perform research tasks as needed.
**Implementation Details:**
- Implement a feedback loop to collect user ratings and use this data to improve the AI model.
- Store feedback in a structured format for analysis.
- Integrate a research module to perform web searches and gather information based on user prompts.

## Next Steps
- Implement the outlined features in the "devinvscode" extension.
- Test each feature thoroughly to ensure it works as intended.
- Document the usage of each feature and provide examples for users.

## Conclusion
The implementation of these automation features will enhance the capabilities of the "devinvscode" extension, making it a powerful tool for developers. By integrating AI and automation, the extension will streamline the development process and improve productivity.
